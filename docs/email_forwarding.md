# Setting Up Email Forwarding for jobba.help

To track your job applications automatically, forward your job-related emails to your personal tracking address. Here's how to set it up in your email client:

## Using Your Personal Tracking Address

When you sign up for jobba.help, you'll receive a personal tracking address in this format:

**track+YOUR_USER_TOKEN@jobba.help**

### Why This Matters

Using your personalized tracking address (with the "+token" part) is essential because:

1. It links forwarded emails to your specific account
2. It ensures your job application data appears in your dashboard
3. It maintains privacy and security by keeping your data separate

### How to Use Your Token

Instead of using the generic track@jobba.help address shown in the examples below:

1. Replace it with your personal tracking address from your account settings
2. The address will look like: track+abc123def456@jobba.help (your token will be different)
3. Use this exact address in all your email forwarding rules

If you've already set up forwarding to the generic address, please update your rules to use your personal tracking address instead.

## Gmail
1. Go to Settings (gear icon) > See all settings
2. Go to the "Filters and Blocked Addresses" tab
