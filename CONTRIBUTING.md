1. Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click **Create and API Key**
3. Copy your API key and save it for later

---

### Create a Google OAuth App 
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).  
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**.  
3. If this is your first time creating credentials with this project, you will have to configure the OAuth consent screen.
4. On the OAuth Consent Screen page, scroll to "Test Users" and add your gmail address.
3. Click **Create Credentials** â†’ **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**.  
4. Set the application type to **Web Application**.  
5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs," add:  
   - https://jobseeker-analytics.onrender.com/login
   - http://localhost:8000/login
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for later.  
7. Download and save your credentials locally to the `backend` folder for this repo in a file named ```credentials.json```

---

### Set Up Environment Variables
1. Copy `backend\.env.example` to `backend\.env`:
   ```sh
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file with your own credentials.
   **ðŸ”’ Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git!**  
3. Copy `frontend\.env.sample` to `frontend\.env`:
   ```sh
   cp frontend/.env.sample frontend/.env
   ```
---


### Run the App: Two options  

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Preferred Option)

1. If this is your first time using Docker, install as below:
   - Install Docker. On Windows/Mac install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). On Linux install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). 
   - Start Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
      - On Windows: make sure to select "Use the WSL 2 based engine" under Settings/general.
      - On Linux: you may need to take additional post-installation steps, see (here)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/]. 
2. Start the app using Docker compose-up. The first time you run this locally it may take a few minutes to set up.
```
docker-compose up --build
```
3. Then, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to begin testing the app locally.
4. Troubleshooting:
   - Attempted import error
      - `cd frontend`
      - `npm ci`

You can view logs from the app by finding your container in Docker Desktop/Docker Engine and clicking on it. The app will automatically refresh when you make changes. 

#### Option 2: Virtual Environment

Once your `.env` file is set up, start the app by following the instructions below:
1. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```sh
   # MAC/LINUX
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   ```sh
   # WINDOWS (CMD)
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
3. Start the PostgreSQL database:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
   - Use Docker to start the PostgreSQL database:
     ```bash
     docker run --name jobseeker-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=jobseeker_analytics -p 5433:5432 -d postgres:13
     ```
4. Run backend and frontend apps:
   In one terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   In another terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```
5. Check it out @:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   
Then, visit `http://localhost:8000/login` to test the authentication flow.

### Inspect the Database with DBeaver

To inspect your PostgreSQL database running in Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Install DBeaver**:
   - Go to the [DBeaver download page](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
   - Download and install the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Start Docker Services (choose one of the commands below to start it if you haven't already)**:
   - Ensure your Docker services are running using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

3. **Create a New Database Connection in DBeaver (if this is your first time opening DBeaver for this project)**:
   - Open DBeaver.
   - - Note: you may need to Download SQLLite driver files - Driver settings window will prompt you.
   - Click on the `Database` menu and select `New Database Connection`.
   - Select `PostgreSQL` and click `Next`.

4. **Enter Connection Details**:
   - **Host**: `localhost`
   - **Port**: `5433` (as specified in your `docker-compose.yaml` file)
   - **Database**: `jobseeker_analytics`
   - **Username**: `postgres`
   - **Password**: `postgres`
   - Click on the `Test Connection` button to ensure the connection is successful.
   - Note: you may need to Download PostgreSQL driver files - Driver settings window will prompt you.

5. **Save the Connection**:
   - If the connection test is successful, click `Finish` to save the connection.
   - If the connection test fails, double-check the connection details and ensure that your Docker services are running.

6. **Inspect the Database**:
   - In the `Database Navigator` pane on the left side of DBeaver, expand the `PostgreSQL` node.
   - Expand the `jobseeker_analytics` node to see the available schemas and tables.
   - Right-click on a table (e.g., `test_table`) and select `View Data` to see the data in the table.


### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Not redirected after login?**  
  Double-check your `REDIRECT_URI` in both `.env` and Google Cloud settings.  
- **Invalid API key errors?**  
  Some Google APIs require API key restrictionsâ€”try generating a new unrestricted key for local testing.  
- **Cannot Build Docker Image?**
   Try option 2, with venv and FastAPI server instead. 

#### When do I need to rebuild Docker? 
- if you change `.env` variables, you'll need to `docker compose down` and `docker compose up --build`

### Submit Changes  
1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Clone** your fork:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes:

   ```
   Note: if you end up using a new Python library (e.g. I just added `ruff`) with `pip install`, be sure to do the following from the `backend` folder:
   `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

   You will need to add the `requirements.txt` file change as a commit, to ensure the environment has all its dependencies and production and local development environments run smoothly.
   ```sh
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "add python library ruff"
   ```
