            <li>I’ll respond as soon as I can to give you access (depends on Google’s beta testing user limits)</li>

                Yes! Let's do this!
            </button>
        </a>

        <h2>"Um... What's so special about another job tracker spreadsheet?"</h2>
        <p>What's special is that the spreadsheet is <strong>automagically updated</strong>.</p>
        <p>You do not have to update the spreadsheet. You login with Google, and bam! </p> 
        <p>The spreadsheet is generated for you.</p>

        <h2>"Uhh... are you going to read all my emails?!"</h2>
        <p>Of course not, I don't have time to read all your emails. :)</p>
        <h2>Here's how it works...</h2>
        <p>When you login to the app with Google, a token is created that expires in 1 hour. </p>
        <p>The token is used to access your Gmail account.</p>
        <p>The app gathers emails that match a predefined filter.</p>

        <p>Relevant data, such as the sender, subject, and date, is extracted into a spreadsheet.</p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>As a job seeker with a Gmail account, I want to be able to calculate my initial application response rate with the touch of a button.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Below is an example of a typical email you'd receive after applying for a role.</p>

        <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <p>At this point, our response rate is <strong>10%</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Thoughts for Later Iterations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Imagine if you could check your response rates against different industries... you could make your job search more targeted and effective.</li>
            <li>Imagine if you had a tool to save the resume you used when applying for roles, and could check the response rates against the resume version you used against a specific industry.</li>
            <li>Imagine if you could track your success rates with referrals, or see at what stage you're getting stuck.</li>
        </ul>
