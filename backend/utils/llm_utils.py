def process_email(email_text):

        Extract the company name and job application status from the following email. 
        Job application status can be a value from the following list:
        ["rejected", "no response", "request for availability", "interview scheduled", "offer"]
        Note that "no response" means that there is only a neutral, automated or human confirmation of the application being received.
        Note that "interview scheduled" implies a calendar invite with a meeting date and time has been sent.
        Note that "request for availability" implies waiting on the candidate to provide their availability.
        Provide the output in JSON format, for example:  "company_name": "company_name", "application_status": "status" 
        Remove backticks. Only use double quotes. Enclose key and value pairs in a single pair of curly braces.
        If the email is obviously not related to a job application, return an empty pair of curly braces like this {{}}
        Email: {email_text}
