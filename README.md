**Option 1: Waitlist**

**[Join the waitlist](https://mail.justajobapp.com/waitlist)** to receive updates when we launch.

**Option 2: Clone**

**Use the app right away on your personal computer**:
   - This means downloading our code and installing the app directly on your computer instead of using our website.
