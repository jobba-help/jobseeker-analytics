# **jobba.help - The Open-Source Job Search Tracker**

## **Overview**

jobba.help is an open-source job search tracker designed to empower jobseekers. 

By integrating with the Gmail API, jobba.help automates tracking and generates insights to improve transparency in hiring.

## **The Vision**

With enough support, jobba.help will overhaul the job search. The more jobseekers contribute, the better insights and tools we generate. 

Imagine the perfect job search:

- **Relevant roles**  - you don't have to visit 10 job boards to find a job
- **Analytics** - you know which industries and company sizes your profile attracts
- **Task organization** - see pending interviews and follow-ups at a glance without digging through hundreds of emails
- **Ghosting exposed** - public leaderboards will discourage bad hiring practices
- **Interview scheduling** is effortless, eliminating back-and-forth emails
- **Asking for help is easy** - Share job search updates with your support system and keep your search visible to the people who can vouch for you

## üì¢ **A note from the maintainer**

Help us build the first open-source job search platform. Join our Discord at [https://discord.gg/5tTT6WVQyw](https://discord.gg/5tTT6WVQyw)

Why open-source, you might ask?

Companies often prioritize their own interests over those of jobseekers, focusing on profit rather than genuine support.

My goal is different.

I envision a community-driven tool, built by the people, for the people, ensuring it remains accessible and beneficial to all jobseekers.

Because it's open-source, future developers can always fork this project and continue the work. 

This is especially important if I, the maintainer, ever win the lottery, retire my computer, and open a cat caf√©. üëÄ
